# Multivariate Lesion-Symptom Mapping Using Support Vector Regression 
# SVR-LSM toolbox

## Theory and background
Lesion analysis is a classic approach to study brain functions. Because brain function is a result of coherent activations of a collection of functionally related voxels, lesion-symptom relations are generally contributed by multiple voxels simultaneously. Although voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) has made substantial contributions to the understanding of brain-behavior relationships, a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship contributed by multiple brain regions needs a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM). The purpose of this artilce was to develop an MLSM using a machine learning-based multivariate regression algorithm: support vector regression (SVR). In the proposed SVR-LSM, the symptom relation to the entire lesion map as opposed to each isolated voxel is modeled using a nonlinear function, so the intervoxel correlations are intrinsically considered, resulting in a potentially more sensitive way to examine lesion-symptom relationships.
